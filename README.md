# US-Medical-Insurance
Codeacademy Portfolio Project: US Medical Insurance Cost

Hi, my name is Chang-Joon and I am a data scientist in training.

This is a simple personal project designed to demonstrate my Python and Pandas knowledge and skills.
Both versions perform data analysis using the US medical insurance cost dataset from Kaggle.

Version 2 only uses Python classes and custom functions without importing NumPy or Pandas modules, and only performs simple statistical analyses.
This version was written when I was first learning Python on my own.

Version 3 incorporates NumPy, Pandas and Seaborn modules for more in-depth statistical analyses and detailed data visualisation.
This version was written while undertaking an industry-accredited data science course offered by Auckland Institute of Technology and the Institute of Data.

Some of the analyses done may not be necessary in real-life situations, but were carried out as hypothetical cases to show my understanding and skillsets.

Please feel free to provide any feedbacks.
